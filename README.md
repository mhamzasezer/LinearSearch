# Linear Search Algorithm
This is a simple C program that demonstrates a linear search algorithm. It reads data from a CSV file and performs a linear search to find a specific key value.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Make sure you have the CSV file named `data.csv` in the same folder of the source code when you run the program. 
3. Compile the program using a C compiler. I recommend using Visual Studio for this project.
4. Run the compiled program.
5. Enter the search key when prompted.
6. The program will output either "Data Not Found" if the key is not found, or the key along with the corresponding data values if the key is found.
